## Formplus Technical Task

It was a really nice experience working on this project. Before this task, I knew a lot about React and Redux but this task forced me to learn more, get better 
and finnessed my skills. 

### Description:
Working with the massive data from the API,I was able to sort it accordingly in the required manners, delivered all the functionalities and reproduced a beffitting UI for the display.
While loading the templates, I used a skeleton screen to show the loading effect. Then moving on, I filtered the result from the API on request by the user (performing a search, order, or date filter) following the required logic all while using redux for state management. Then finishing up, I wrote some few tests using "React Testing Library" and "JEST".
